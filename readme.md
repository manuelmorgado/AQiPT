# 📦 AQiPT: Atomic Quantum Information Processing Toolbox

**AQiPT** is an open-source, modular, and extensible software framework for the control and management of quantum devices and associated hardware components. Designed in Python, AQiPT provides a high-level abstraction layer, modular hardware drivers, instruction scheduling, and data management capabilities, enabling flexible and scalable experimental workflows.

Originally developed in the context of academic research, AQiPT is optimized for atomic physics experiments and atom-based quantum computing platforms, offering seamless integration between experimental automation and digital twin architectures.

AQiPT is fully cross-platform (Linux and Windows) and free of licensing fees, making it a versatile tool for research, development, and education in quantum information science and engineering.

Its open architecture is designed to encourage community contributions and collaborative development.
